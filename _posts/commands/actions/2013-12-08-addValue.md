Add a value to an object found by a selector. You can also use unicode characters
like Left arrow or Back space. You'll find all supported characters [here](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/element/:id/value). To do that,
the value has to correspond to a key from the table.
