Sets a value to an object found by a css selector (clears value before). You can also
use unicode characters like Left arrow or Back space. You'll find all supported
characters [here](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/element/:id/value).
To do that, the value has to correspond to a key from the table.
