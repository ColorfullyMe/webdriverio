What is WebdriverJS?
--------------------

WebdriverJS is a webdriver module for nodejs. It comes up with many commands
to control the browser behavior for your BDD tests.

It is written so its easy to add new protocol implementations and add helper
commands so make testing easier. Each command resides as one file inside the
node module folder which makes it easy to extend.

The two main reasons for this projects are:

1. Ease of use - Writing tests with webdriver should be very easy
2. Easy to extend - Adding helper functions, or more complicated sets and combinations of existing commands, should also be very easy.
